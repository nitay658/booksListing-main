# BooksListing
Books recommendation App.

The app utilizes a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with weighted features to recommend books based on a user's personal list. This approach involves calculating the similarity between books in the user's list and other books in the database, considering various weighted parameters to determine the most relevant recommendations.
