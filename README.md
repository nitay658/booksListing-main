# BooksListing

BooksListing is a book recommendation app designed to help users discover new reads based on their personal preferences.

## Overview

The app utilizes a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with weighted features to recommend books tailored to each user's tastes. By calculating the similarity between books in the user's list and other books in the database, the app provides personalized recommendations that prioritize relevance and user preferences.

## How It Works

1. **Personalized Book List**: Users can create their personalized book lists, including books they've read, enjoyed, or are interested in exploring further.

2. **Database Search and Book Addition**: The app allows users to search the database for additional books to add to their list. These selections contribute to refining the recommendation algorithm.

3. **Recommendation System**: Leveraging the KNN algorithm with weighted features, the app generates personalized book recommendations based on the user's list and preferences.

- Sign up or log in to your account.
- Create your personal book list.
- Explore the database and add books to refine your recommendations.
- Receive personalized book recommendations based on your preferences.


## Next Asignments:
User Preferences and Algorithm Customization:

- Allow users to set preferences such as favorite genres, authors, or topics. These preferences can be used to customize the weighting of features in the KNN algorithm.
- Implement a user interface where users can adjust weights for different features or parameters of the algorithm, providing them with more control over their recommendations.

Search Section Improvements:

- Enhance the search functionality to provide more intuitive and accurate results. Consider implementing features such as autocomplete suggestions, fuzzy search, or advanced filtering options.
- Integrate natural language processing (NLP) techniques to improve the understanding of user queries and provide more relevant search results.
  
Algorithm Enhancement:

- Continuously refine and optimize the KNN algorithm to improve recommendation accuracy and performance.
- Experiment with different distance metrics, such as cosine similarity or Pearson correlation coefficient, to better capture the similarity between books and enhance the recommendation quality.

Happy reading!
