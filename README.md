# BooksListing

BooksListing is a book recommendation app designed to help users discover new reads based on their personal preferences.

## Overview

The app utilizes a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with weighted features to recommend books tailored to each user's tastes. By calculating the similarity between books in the user's list and other books in the database, the app provides personalized recommendations that prioritize relevance and user preferences.

## How It Works

1. **Personalized Book List**: Users can create their personalized book lists, including books they've read, enjoyed, or are interested in exploring further.

2. **Database Search and Book Addition**: The app allows users to search the database for additional books to add to their list. These selections contribute to refining the recommendation algorithm.
